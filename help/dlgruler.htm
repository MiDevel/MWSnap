<h1><img border="0" src="btn/btnRuler.bmp" width="20" height="20"> Ruler tool</h1>


<p>The ruler tool is a comfortable tool for quick measuring of sizes of screen
objects (in pixels.) After invoking the command a ruler similar to the one shown
below appears:</p>


<p><img border="0" src="pics/ruler.gif" width="474" height="63"></p>


<p>The ruler can be freely dragged over the screen using the mouse simply by dragging any of its
points. To resize the ruler by 5 pixels use the arrows keys (with &lt;Shift&gt;
to resize precisely, and with &lt;Ctrl&gt; to resize by 50 pixels). To quickly
resize the ruler drag the widget in the bottom-right corner. <b>To close the ruler tool and to return back to the program press
&lt;Esc&gt;</b> or select &quot;Close&quot; from the local menu. Note that the
number to the right of the &quot;hole&quot; shows the precise distance of the
mouse cursor position to the &quot;0&quot; on the scale.</p>


<p>The ruler's &quot;hole&quot; contains a hidden functionality. When clicked,
it pops up a local menu containing the following options:</p>


<h3>Horizontal ruler</h3>


<p>Enables the horizontal ruler (default). Shortcut: &lt;Ctrl+H&gt;.</p>


<h3>Vertical ruler</h3>


<p>Enables the vertical ruler. Shortcut: &lt;Ctrl+V&gt;.</p>


<h3>Toggle the ruler direction</h3>


<p>Changes the direction of the scale on the ruler from left-to-right to
right-to-left. The arrows next to the ruler &quot;hole&quot; show the current
direction. It's also possible to click the arrows to quickly change the
direction. Shortcut: &lt;Ctrl+D&gt;.</p>


<h3>Help</h3>

<h3>Close</h3>


<p>Closes the ruler tool. Shortcuts: &lt;Ctrl+F4&gt; or &lt;Esc&gt;.</p>
