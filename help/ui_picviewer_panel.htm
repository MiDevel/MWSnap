<h1>Picture viewer</h1>

<img border="0" src="pics/captpanel_view.gif" width="158" height="302" align="left">MWSnap
contains a built-in fast picture viewer, integrated with the <a href="uicapturepanel.htm">capture
panel</a>.
<p>The illustration to the left shows the picture viewer in action. The picture
viewer consists of 4 separate sections: the drives list, the folders tree, the picture type mask (In the example all supported picture
types are allowed) and the list of pictures found in the selected folder.</p>
<p>In order to view a picture select the disk, navigate to the proper
folder and click the picture name on the bottom list. The picture will be opened
and shown in the MWSnap <a href="uipreviewpanel.htm">preview panel</a>. Such opened image
behaves like a regular snapped image - it can be now saved in another format or <a href="mnu_edit.htm#transform">transformed</a>
using any of the program editing options.</p>

<p>Right-clicking a picture name on the list opens a local menu with the
following options:</p>


<h3>Open picture</h3>


<p>Identical to left-clicking the file - just opens and displays the picture.</p>


<h3>Start picture</h3>


<p>Invokes an application associated in the system with this file type and
passes this picture file as a parameter.</p>


<h3>Rename file</h3>


<p>Allows to assign another name to the selected picture file.</p>


<h3>Delete file</h3>


<p>Allows to delete the picture file from the disk.</p>
