<h3><a name="captfixed"><img border="0" src="btn/btnCaptFixed.bmp" width="20" height="20">
 Fixed-size rectangle</a></h3>


<p>Use this command to activate fixed size rectangular areas snapping. After a
predefined pause (usually 0.6 s) necessary for hiding MWSnap and stabilizing the
system a rectangular frame appears on the screen. In order to capture a part of
the screen the frame should be dragged to the proper location. After clicking
using the left mouse button or pressing &lt;Enter&gt; key the image within the
frame will be captured and displayed in the <a href="uipreviewpanel.htm">preview
panel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

within the zoom box for higher accuracy. Cursor keys allow pixel-wise cursor
pointer movement. &lt;F6&gt; key allows hiding/showing the zoom box.</p>

area. After defining the second vertex, the image within the frame will be
captured and displayed in the <a href="uipreviewpanel.htm">preview panel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

within the zoom box for higher accuracy. Cursor keys allow pixel-wise cursor
pointer movement. &lt;F6&gt; key allows hiding/showing the zoom box. While
defining the second vertex, &lt;Space&gt; key allows toggling activity of the
first/second vertex for eventual area adjustment.</p>
