<h1>Status bar</h1>


<p><img border="0" src="pics/sttbar.gif" width="450" height="19"></p>


<p>Status bar is displayed at the very bottom of the application's window. It's
separated into three panels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>info panel,</li>
  <li>zoom level panel,</li>
  <li>image size panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Info panel</b> shows various information during working with the program.
It shows more detailed descriptions of focused user interface elements like
buttons, and is used for displaying information about the program state and its
last actions, like auto-saving.</p>
<p><b>Zoom level panel</b> shows the current zoom level as a percent of the
magnification. 100% means no zooming. Minimal zoom is 10%, maximal 2000%.</p>
<p><b>Image size</b> panel displays the size of the currently captured image.
Note that if the size does not appear on the <a href="uimenus.htm#captfixed">fixed
sizes</a> list, the <a href="uimenus.htm#addfixedsize">&quot;Add fixed size&quot;</a>
command is active.</p>
