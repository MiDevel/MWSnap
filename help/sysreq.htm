<h1>System requirements</h1>
<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>


<p>MWSnap has minimal hardware requirements, It should work successfully on any
hardware capable of running any 32-bit version of Windows.</p>


<h3>Software requirements</h3>


<p>MWSnap needs for running any version of 32-bit Windows. The program is
self-contained, i.e., it does not need or depend to any system libraries,
installed updates, patches etc.</p>


<p>I'd be thankful for reporting specifications of a system where MWSnap did not
work correctly.</p>
