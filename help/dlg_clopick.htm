<h1><img border="0" src="btn/btnColorPicker.bmp" width="20" height="20"> Color picker tool</h1>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/colorpicker.gif" align="left" width="172" height="232">The
color picker tool makes it possible to read the color information of selected
pixels on the screen and to convert it to a format that can be used in graphics
applications, in programming or when designing Web Pages.</p>

<p>The picture to the left shows the color picker tool in action. The left top
area of the color picker window shows a zoomed portion of the screen around the
current cursor position. The exact location of the cursor is marked with a cross
in the zoomed preview (if the location isn't marked, you may want to enable it
in <a href="dlgsettings.htm">Settings</a>/<a href="dlgsettings_snapping.htm">Snapping</a>.)The cursor can
be freely moved over the frozen screen what will dynamically update the color
picker window readings. The cursor can be also moved precisely using the cursor
keys.</p>

<p>The zoom level can be changed using the &lt;+&gt; or &lt;-&gt; keys.&nbsp; Use the keys from the numeric pad for maximal comfort.</p>

<p>The RGB value of the center pixel is shown in the bottom part of the color
picker window. It's possible to see this value in other systems pressing the
&lt;Space&gt; key. In a new dialog box that will appear the color is shown as
RGB, in HTML and Delphi syntax and using the system name (if it exists.)</p>

<p>The colorful boxes on the right edge of the color picker window are color
memory slots. Each clicked color is put to the top-most memory slot, all
existing colors get shifted down. One can click on memory slots to recall their
colors.</p>


<p>To place the Color picker window at another position simply drag its title bar to
another location.</p>
