<p>System-wide hotkeys implemented in MWSnap make it possible to start capturing
or starting available tools immediately without prior activating the MWSnap window. MWSnap can be hidden
below other windows, or can be minimized or iconized - it will listen for its
hot key combinations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A hot key is a combination of at least 2 keys: a base key (A..Z, F1..F12)
plus any set of &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;, and &lt;Ctrl&gt; keys.&nbsp; Hot keys configuration dialog allows defining custom
hot keys for all
capturing modes. It allows also enabling all or only selected hotkeys.</p>


<p>Hot keys must be unique in the whole system. In case an application has been
started that uses the same combination of the keys, MWSnap will report it and
deactivate the conflicting hot key. The hot keys dialog will mark such
conflicting hot keys in red.</p>


<p>MWSnap defines the hotkeys for all available capturing modes and all dynamic
tools. The picture below shows the default hotkeys assignments:</p>

<p><b>Note!</b><br>
For hotkeys to work MWSnap MUST be started. It doesn't have to stay open on the
screen - it can be minimized or iconized (minimized to the system tray).</p>
