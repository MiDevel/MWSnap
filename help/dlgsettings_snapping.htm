<h1>Snapping settings</h1>


<h3>Delay before snapping [ms]</h3>


<p>Use this field to define the delay (in ms) MWSnap will wait with capturing.
The delay is necessary for MWSnap to hide it's window and to refresh the
display. As a rule slower computers need higher values. For 300-500MHz machines
the delay of 600 ms is usually sufficient.</p>


<h3>Hide MWSnap before snapping</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want MWSnap's window to hide itself before capturing
is performed. Uncheck the option if you want MWSnap to capture its own image :)</p>


<h3>Restore MWSnap after snapping</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want MWSnap to restore from the minimized state
after performing snapping. Note that if MWSnap is not minimized when sapping is
called, it will be always restored regardless of this setting.</p>


<h3>Show snap preview window (F6 toggles)</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want to see the zoomed preview of the screen area
around the cursor while capturing areas. The preview window makes it easier to
capture the selected area with the pixel accuracy.</p>


<h3>Mark cursor position in snap preview</h3>


<p>Check this option is you want to see precisely the cursor position when
capturing rectangular areas. The cursor position marking makes it easier to
perform precise captures, but in some cases it can be obtrusive.</p>


<h3>Auto copy snapped image to the clipboard</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want every captured image to be automatically put on
Windows clipboard. This setting is especially useful when you insert captured
images directly to the word processor or an HTML editor.</p>


<h3>Auto print snapped image</h3>


<p>Check this option when you want to automatically print all snapped images.
Images will be printed using last manually specified parameters.</p>
