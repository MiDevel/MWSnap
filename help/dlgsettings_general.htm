<h1>General settings</h1>


<h3>Warn at start about conflicting hotkeys</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want to be notified about conflicting system-wide
hotkeys. In case of hotkeys conflicts go to the <a href="dlghotkey.htm">Hotkeys
configuration dialog</a> and select unique hotkeys for items marked in red.</p>


<h3>Auto-start with Windows</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want MWSnap to start automatically with Windows to
be always available. When enabling this option, consider checking also the &quot;Start minimized&quot;
option.</p>


<h3>Minimize to tray</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want minimized MWSnap to appear as a tiny icon in the system tray
(where the clock is displayed) instead of a standard big button in the task bar.</p>


<p>Note that left-clicking MWSnap's icon in the system tray restores the program
window. Right-clicking it opens a popup menu with all most often used commands.</p>


<h3>Start minimized</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want the program to start in minimized mode. Note
that it's possible to start in minimized mode only when minimizing to the system
tray has been selected.</p>


<h3>Minimize on closing the main window using the button [X]</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want the program to minimize despite the system
Close button has been clicked. Regardless of this setting selecting the Exit <img border="0" src="btn/btnExit.bmp" width="20" height="20">
button will always terminate the program.</p>


<h3>Always show icon in tray</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want the program to show an icon in the system tray
even when the application is not minimized. It's recommended to have this option
activated because the tray icon offers a quick access to the capturing menu
(invoked with right-clicking the icon.)</p>


<h3>Confirm files overwriting</h3>


<p>Check this option if you want the program to warn you if a file with the same
name you are trying to use for saving already exists.</p>


<h3>Undo stack size</h3>


<p>Use this field to specify the number of image states MWSnap should retain for undoing.
Set the number to 0 to disable Undo.<br>
Warning!<br>
For large images each Undo step can consume even 1-2 MB of RAM.</p>
