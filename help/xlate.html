<h1>Adding new language versions</h1>

<p>The program offers support for custom language modules. To add your own module, please follow these
simple steps.
</p>

<p>In the folder where the program is installed, open the \Lang folder and make a copy of the "English.ini" file, and name it according to the language you want to add.
(for example
&quot;German.ini&quot; or even better &quot;Deutsch.ini&quot; for a German module).
Please don't change the file extension, it must remain .ini.
</p>

<p>Now open the file with a text editor like system Notepad, and translate the strings to the new language.
Each string is represented in the form
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>name=contents</pre>

</blockquote>

<p>Please translate only the contents (the part after the &quot;=&quot; sign.)
The name serves as a string identifier and must remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>Here is a small example:
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>frmMain.optRecordCopy.Caption=Duplicate record
frmMain.optCatRename.Caption=Rename category
rsDeleteRec=Delete current record?</pre>

</blockquote>
<p>The strings like &quot;frmMain.optRecordCopy.Caption&quot; are identifiers.
Please translate only texts &quot;Duplicate record&quot;, &quot;Rename category&quot;,
&quot;Delete current record?&quot; in this case.
</p>

<p>Make sure you don't exceed the length of the particular strings too much, if
they appear within dialog boxes. All dialogs are designed with translation in
mind so there is usually some extra space for longer translations, but be sure
to check if your texts are not trimmed.
</p>

<h3>Special characters
</h3>

<p>In some texts several special characters can appear.
</p>

<h4>%s, %d
</h4>

<p>These are placeholders and will be expanded to values when the program runs.
%s is a placeholder for a text and %d is a placeholder for a numerical value.
Please leave placeholders in your translated version, just place them at the
proper position.
</p>

<p>Examples:<br>
&quot;Text [%s] was not found&quot; will be expanded at runtime for example to
&quot;Text [e-mail] was not found&quot;<br>
&quot;Count of records: %d&quot; will be expanded at runtime for example to
&quot;Count of records: 243&quot;
</p>

<h4>&amp;
</h4>

<p>Hot key symbol. If the text being translated is a button's caption or a menu
item, one of characters can be preceded with the hot key symbol. It will then
automatically get underlined and will be selectable using the standard Windows
&lt;Alt-character&gt; combination.
</p>

<p>Example:<br>
&quot;&amp;Cancel&quot; will appear as &quot;<u>C</u>ancel&quot;, &lt;Alt-C&gt;
will activate this button automatically.
</p>

<h4>*|*
</h4>

<p>This symbol stands for a line break (carriage return). It is used in long strings, for example in
messages and warnings.
</p>

<p>Example:<br>
rsFileXNotFound=File*|*[%s]*|*has not been found!
</p>

<h3>Country flags
</h3>

<p>After saving the file, you can supply a small 32 x 20 bitmap that represents your
country. It will be displayed in the language selection window. In order to have
the program combine the bitmap with the .ini file, it must have exactly the same filename (just with a .bmp extension).
</p>

<p>For example :<br>
Dutch.ini (language module)<br>
Dutch.bmp (optional country flag)
</p>

<p>I have a large collection of flags pictures, so ask me before drawing a new
one.
</p>

<h3>About the Translator
</h3>

<p>Three first lines of the message module allow adding the translator details
and show up in the running program when selecting the language module. You can
put there whatever you want, including your name, URL, etc.
</p>

<p>Example:<br>
Info1=English translation<br>
Info2=By Mirek Wójtowicz<br>
Info3=http://www.mirekw.com
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>To install and test the new language module, just copy both .ini and .bmp files into the
\Lang subfolder, and choose the new language using the Tools/Language option.
</p>

<p>Please send your language modules to <a href="mailto:translations@mirekw.com">translations@mirekw.com</a>
if you want to have them included in new releases of the program. Please notice that
we cannot publish multiple versions for a language, as long as the new version is not an improvement to the existing version.
</p>

<p>Thank you for your contribution!
