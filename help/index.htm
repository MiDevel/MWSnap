<h1>MWSnap v. 3.0</h1>
<p>MWSnap is a small yet powerful Windows program for snapping (capturing)
images from selected parts of the screen. Current version is capable of
capturing the whole desktop, a highlighted window, an active menu, or a fixed or free rectangular
part of the screen. MWSnap handles 5 most popular graphics formats and contains
important graphical tools: a zoom, a ruler, a color picker and a window spy.</p>
<p>MWSnap <b> is free</b> for both commercial and non-commercial use. You
are free to put the programs on a CD-ROM, but if you do so please send me a
notification (and a copy of the CD, if possible.) And of course spread the
